                  As a tutor, eTutor is definitely one of the best platforms
                  that I've used since I began giving tuition 6 years ago. It
                  keeps all my classes neat and organised, and I can track all
                  my classes and student lists on just one easy-to-use platform.

                  I encountered eTutor when I was looking for a tutor on my
                  daughter's behalf. I found out that not only was the platform
                  completely free-of-charge, the quality of tutors listed are
                  pretty good here - not to mention, your child's privacy is
                  protected because only tutees can search and view tutor
                  profiles! Tutors only receive your information if you initiate
                  a notification.

                  I enjoy using this platform as the sign up was really quick
                  and easy, and tutor searching is also just a click away! I was
                  able to find a Math tutor in less than 2 days as the tutor was
                  very responsive and guided me on how to book lessons with him
                  on the platform.
